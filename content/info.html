I'm passionate about finding where the needs of a client overlap with the wants and needs of their user base, and then creating beautiful, scalable, accessible products out of that space. The result is captivating, relational user experience.<p>I graduated from Purdue University in December 2016 with a Bachelors in Computer Graphics Technology, specializing in Web Design and Development. From 2015 to late 2017, I was the Design Lead for Expimetrics, a startup based at Purdue. Currently, I'm the UI Design Strategist for nimblejack, an Indianapolis marketing agency.<p>Aside from visual design, I also love more auditory mediumsâ€”namely music. I built a small home studio where I write, record and produce for my new solo project. I also have the honor of getting to lead worship through my church.<p style="margin-bottom: 60px">Lastly, I'm most passionate about people. I hope and pray that the work I do genuinely serves those I do it for.
