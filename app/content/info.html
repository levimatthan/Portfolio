							<p style="color: #094C3D;">My name is Levi Matthan Schrumpf.</p>
							<p>I am a son, a brother, a friend, a designer, a musician, a believer, and a child at heart.</p>
							<p>Over the last four years, I've learned a lot about the design process from both leading projects and working on teams. I'm passionate about finding where the needs of a client overlap with the wants and needs of their user base, and then creating beautiful, research-backed systems out of that space. The result is captivating, unforgettable user experience.</p>
							<p>I graduated from Purdue University in December 2016 with a Bachelors in Computer Graphics Technology, specializing in Web Design and Development. From 2015 to late 2017, I was the Design Lead for Expimetrics, a startup based at Purdue. Currently, I'm the UI Design Strategist for nimblejack, an Indianapolis marketing agency.</p>
							<p>When I'm not designing, I'm probably working on music from my home studio. My first release is coming soon, and I couldn't be more excited about it!</p>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">As much as I love to create, I love people more. If you'd like to talk about design, something you need done, life, or anything else, <a href="#contact">get in touch with me!</a></p>
