							<p style="color: #094C3D;">My name is Levi Matthan Schrumpf.</p>
							<p>I am a son, a brother, a friend, a designer, a musician, a believer, and a child at heart.</p>
							<p>I graduated from Purdue University in December 2016 with a Bachelors in Computer Graphics Technology, specializing in Web Design and Development. For the past two years, I've worked as the Director of Design & User Experience for Expimetrics, a startup I've helped build. I also do freelance work for various clients, and pro bono work for nonprofits like Songs Against Slavery.</p>
							<p>This is a site showcasing a small portion of the UI and graphic design and development work I've done.</p>
							<p>When I'm not designing, I'm probably working on music from my home studio. My first release is coming soon, and I couldn't be more excited about it!</p>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 60px;">Designing and creative work are wonderful things, but most of all I love people. If you'd like to talk about design, something you need done, life, or anything else, <a href="#contact">get in touch with me!</a></p>
